# Title: Debugging PHP

Excercices to debug PHP

- Repository: `debuggingPHP`
- Link github: https://github.com/elduderinow/debuggingPHP
- Language: HTML, SCSS, PHP

## PURPOSE
- understanding the root of bug fixing
- know what print_r, var_dump, die, echo, exit, break do
- know what to do the next time you're stuck
- give yourself the `solver's mentality`, a problem is just an opportunity to learn!


## PROGRESS
- was relatively easy, had to google a few times but most of the time I managed.


## THE PROJECT ITSELF & MY OPINION
Good nice excercices to think outside the box and debug!
